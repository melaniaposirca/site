          <h1 class="Subtitlu">Taylor Swift</h1>
          <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.</p>
          <p>Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005, and released her eponymous debut studio album in 2006. </p>
          <p>The media scrutiny on Swift's personal life influenced her sixth album Reputation (2017), which delved into urban sounds, led by the single "Look What You Made Me Do". She parted ways with Big Machine to sign with Republic Records in 2018, and released her next studio album, Lover, in 2019. </p>
